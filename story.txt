Once upon a time, there is a brave and powerful general who is the son of a king
in ancient China. However, in a historical war, he was seriously injured and 
was caught by a nameless soilder.
The general was brought to a massive camp, and tossed into a pitch black dungeon all alone. In dire need of medical attention and food, the general expected the worst. However, on the third day of his inprisonment, friendly troops raided the camp and the general was freed.
After returning home, though, the general was a hero to all. This general still felt defeated, but his fight was done and he could be home with his family.
